# Overview
I am learning Java and am very excited
to learn as much as I can in a short amount of time.

My overall purpose in learning Java is not only to
grow as a person, but also that I may expand my Portfolio.
I am going to build a Password Manager in Java later down
the road. That is why I am learning Java.
